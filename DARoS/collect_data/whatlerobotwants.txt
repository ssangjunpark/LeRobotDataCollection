        2 modes are available for instantiating this class, depending on 2 different use cases:

        1. Your dataset already exists:
            - On your local disk in the 'root' folder. This is typically the case when you recorded your
              dataset locally and you may or may not have pushed it to the hub yet. Instantiating this class
              with 'root' will load your dataset directly from disk. This can happen while you're offline (no
              internet connection).

            - On the Hugging Face Hub at the address https://huggingface.co/datasets/{repo_id} and not on
              your local disk in the 'root' folder. Instantiating this class with this 'repo_id' will download
              the dataset from that address and load it, pending your dataset is compliant with
              codebase_version v2.0. If your dataset has been created before this new format, you will be
              prompted to convert it using our conversion script from v1.6 to v2.0, which you can find at
              lerobot/common/datasets/v2/convert_dataset_v1_to_v2.py.


        2. Your dataset doesn't already exists (either on local disk or on the Hub): you can create an empty
           LeRobotDataset with the 'create' classmethod. This can be used for recording a dataset or port an
           existing dataset to the LeRobotDataset format.


        In terms of files, LeRobotDataset encapsulates 3 main things:
            - metadata:
                - info contains various information about the dataset like shapes, keys, fps etc.
                - stats stores the dataset statistics of the different modalities for normalization
                - tasks contains the prompts for each task of the dataset, which can be used for
                  task-conditioned training.
            - hf_dataset (from datasets.Dataset), which will read any values from parquet files.
            - videos (optional) from which frames are loaded to be synchronous with data from parquet files.

        A typical LeRobotDataset looks like this from its root path:

        Note that this file-based structure is designed to be as versatile as possible. The files are split by
        episodes which allows a more granular control over which episodes one wants to use and download. The
        structure of the dataset is entirely described in the info.json file, which can be easily downloaded
        or viewed directly on the hub before downloading any actual data. The type of files used are very
        simple and do not need complex tools to be read, it only uses .parquet, .json and .mp4 files (and .md
        for the README).

        Args:
            repo_id (str): This is the repo id that will be used to fetch the dataset. Locally, the dataset
                will be stored under root/repo_id.
            root (Path | None, optional): Local directory to use for downloading/writing files. You can also
                set the LEROBOT_HOME environment variable to point to a different location. Defaults to
                '~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot'.
            episodes (list[int] | None, optional): If specified, this will only load episodes specified by
                their episode_index in this list. Defaults to None.
            image_transforms (Callable | None, optional): You can pass standard v2 image transforms from
                torchvision.transforms.v2 here which will be applied to visual modalities (whether they come
                from videos or images). Defaults to None.
            delta_timestamps (dict[list[float]] | None, optional): _description_. Defaults to None.
            tolerance_s (float, optional): Tolerance in seconds used to ensure data timestamps are actually in
                sync with the fps value. It is used at the init of the dataset to make sure that each
                timestamps is separated to the next by 1/fps +/- tolerance_s. This also applies to frames
                decoded from video files. It is also used to check that `delta_timestamps` (when provided) are
                multiples of 1/fps. Defaults to 1e-4.
            revision (str, optional): An optional Git revision id which can be a branch name, a tag, or a
                commit hash. Defaults to current codebase version tag.
            sync_cache_first (bool, optional): Flag to sync and refresh local files first. If True and files
                are already present in the local cache, this will be faster. However, files loaded might not
                be in sync with the version on the hub, especially if you specified 'revision'. Defaults to
                False.
            download_videos (bool, optional): Flag to download the videos. Note that when set to True but the
                video files are already present on local disk, they won't be downloaded again. Defaults to
                True.
            video_backend (str | None, optional): Video backend to use for decoding videos. Defaults to torchcodec when available int the platform; otherwise, defaults to 'pyav'.
                You can also use the 'pyav' decoder used by Torchvision, which used to be the default option, or 'video_reader' which is another decoder of Torchvision.
